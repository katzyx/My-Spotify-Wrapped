Spotify Reference


Design Flow
1. create app to access app credentials
    - required for access token
    - required for API authorization
2. Tutorials:
    - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started
    - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/howtos/web-app-profile


Access Tokens
    - to use access token, must have Authorization header parameter
    - access token valid for 1 hour, must get new one after

API Calls
    - restful API with different endpoints that return JSON metadata from Spotify Data Catalogue
    - base address: https://api.spotify.com
    - all API requests require authorization
    - access data via HTTP requests in UTF-8 format to API endpoint
    - API returns JSON in response body (or HTTP status code)

Apps
    - app provides Client ID and Client Secret needed for authorization

Authorization
    - implements OAuth 2.0 authorization framework
        - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749
    - access to protected resouces is determined by scopes
        - scopes enable app to access functionality
    - scopes set during authorization determines access permissions
    - authorization process requires client credentials (ID and secret)
    - server issues access token, used to make API calls

Playlists
    - find a playlist using its Spotify ID
    - can retrun information on any local files
